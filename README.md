Bad Movie Podcast: The App

[iTunes App Store Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bad-movie-podcast-the-app/id559659353?mt=8&ls=1)

I threw this app together over a few nights in 2012 (with a lot of other hacking nights to get it released) to have something specifically for our [podcast](http://badmoviepodcast.com). Since the app is old and I probably won't update it, I'm open-sourcing it. This was mostly a hacked together app so there is probably no wisdom to find in it, but it does do some cool animations. :)
